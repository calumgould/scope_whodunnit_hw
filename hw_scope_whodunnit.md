# Scope Homework: Who Dunnit

### Learning Objectives

- Understand function scope
- Know the difference in between the let and const keywords

## Brief

Using your knowledge about scope and variable declarations in JavaScript, look at the following code snippets and predict what the output or error will be and why. Copy the following episodes into a JavaScript file and add comments under each one detailing the reason for your predicted output.

### MVP

#### Episode 1

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Library',
  weapon: 'Rope'
};

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${scenario.murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

<!-- Miss Scarlet because the declareMurderer function has access to the scenario const as it's defined outside of the function. -->

#### Episode 2

```js
const murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

//  An error will be given as you can't change a const variable which it is trying to do on line 39, assigning murderer = 'Mrs Peacock'
```

#### Episode 3

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const declareMurderer = function() {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const firstVerdict = declareMurderer();
console.log('First Verdict: ', firstVerdict);

const secondVerdict = `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
console.log('Second Verdict: ', secondVerdict);

// firstVerdict and will be Mrs. Peacock as the declareMurderer function changed it to that when it was called equal to firstVerdict. The secondVerdict will be professor plum as the murderer was reset back to professor plum as soon as the declareMurderer function was finished.
```

#### Episode 4

```js
let suspectOne = 'Miss Scarlet';
let suspectTwo = 'Professor Plum';
let suspectThree = 'Mrs. Peacock';

const declareAllSuspects = function() {
  let suspectThree = 'Colonel Mustard';
  return `The suspects are ${suspectOne}, ${suspectTwo}, ${suspectThree}.`;
}

const suspects = declareAllSuspects();
console.log(suspects);
console.log(`Suspect three is ${suspectThree}.`);

// suspects will be Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Colonel Mustard as it was assigned to the result of the declareAllSuspects function, but suspectThree will still be Mrs. Peacock as it was never resassigned.
```

#### Episode 5

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Kitchen',
  weapon: 'Candle Stick'
};

const changeWeapon = function(newWeapon) {
  scenario.weapon = newWeapon;
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is the ${scenario.weapon}.`;
}

changeWeapon('Revolver');
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);

// The new weapon would be the Revolver instead of the candle stick as even though the scenario object is a constant, it is still mutable. Meaning it's key values can be changed, as done so in the changeWeapon function
```

#### Episode 6

```js
let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    murderer = 'Mrs. White';
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function () {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

// the declareMurderer function will return 'The murderer is Mrs.White', but then when the changeMurderer function is called before the verdict const is defined, it changes the murderer to Mr. Green, then back to Mrs.White when the plotTwist function is called at the end.
```

#### Episode 7

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

    const unexpectedOutcome = function() {
      murderer = 'Miss Scarlet';
    }

    unexpectedOutcome();
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

// The murderer will be Mr.Green as both Colonel Mustard and Miss Scarlet have no scope outside of the plotTwist function and is assigned to a let, which is being resassigned by the unexpectedOutcome function but still is only ever that value inside the plotTwist block.
```

#### Episode 8

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Mrs. Peacock',
  room: 'Conservatory',
  weapon: 'Lead Pipe'
};

const changeScenario = function() {
  scenario.murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  scenario.room = 'Dining Room';

  const plotTwist = function(room) {
    if (scenario.room === room) {
      scenario.murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';
    }

    const unexpectedOutcome = function(murderer) {
      if (scenario.murderer === murderer) {
        scenario.weapon = 'Candle Stick';
      }
    }

    unexpectedOutcome('Colonel Mustard');
  }

  plotTwist('Dining Room');
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is ${scenario.weapon}.`
}

changeScenario();
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);

// When changeScenario is called it keeps the murderer the same but changes the room to dining room, then when plotTwist is called next, that matches the murder room, so it makes Colonel Mustard the murderer, which when passed into unexpectedOutcome, that matches the murderer, making the murder weapon the candlestick, which is then declared in the verdict
```

#### Episode 9

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

if (murderer === 'Professor Plum') {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

// The murderer will remain as Professor Plum, because the let inside the if statement has no scope outside the block, hence cannot change the murderer variable outside.
```
